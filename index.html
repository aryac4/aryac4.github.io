       <p> One Direction is a pop band based in London created by the X- Factor. The band consisted of <strong> Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and Zayn Malik 
         </strong>(until he left in 2015). When Zayn had left the band, One Direction dissolved around a couple years later. Though, they did fall apart, many fans still love One Direction.
